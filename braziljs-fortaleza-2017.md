Imagine you don’t have Null, undefined or NaN in your JavaScript code? In this talk [Jean Carlo Emer]() explained how useful types and immutability can be in your code.

Some of the common problems JavaScript developers has nowadays can be fixed using TypeChecking, for example. He introduced Flow and TypeScript. Type can be used as a design tool and can be also as [a communication mechanism](https://twitter.com/sarahmei/status/899130743535812608).

You are a parser

She explained What parser is. 
Talked about all the steps in the process with a high level code sample

Code generation
	step from the AST to the actual result (svg in her example)

Live code sample with site (what is the address?)
	showcases compilation errors

	https://astexplorer.net/
	She did a live code showcasing how to transform a string into a gif
		Babel js - compiler for JS	
	
Showcased how to publish the babel plugin that was written in the example
ran the babel tool to showcase the written plugin

Babel needs help
	Suggestions

		fika script ( js in filandes***)

There things learned

		it’s okay to have unfamiliar things
	be a good parser
		don’t be a jerk with a bad error message
	bridge the gap like a transformer
		context is everything
